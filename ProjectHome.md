The Nintendo Wiimote contains a very special Infrared camera that not only senses sources of infrared light, but tracks the coordinates of up to four separate point sources at high frame rates.

Using a microcontroller to interface with the camera, retrieve the four objects, and report their coordinates to this application which plots the objects in realtime.

You'll need to install the [RXTXcomm](http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/) native library for this to work. (DLL, jnilib, etc)
